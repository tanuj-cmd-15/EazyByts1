# CRM Web Application

This CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application is built using Spring Boot MVC, Thymeleaf, Hibernate, MySQL, and Java 17. The application provides a comprehensive solution for managing customer interactions, tasks, appointments, and communication. It also integrates with various Google services, including Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Calendar, to enhance productivity and collaboration.

## **Prerequisites**

Before installing the CRM application, ensure the following:

- Java 17 is installed on your machine.
- MySQL database is set up and running.
- Obtain valid MySQL connection details (URL, username, password).
- Obtain Google API credentials for integration with Google services (Drive, Gmail, Calendar).

## Installation

To install and run the CRM application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Configure the MySQL database connection details in the `application.properties` file:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/crm?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=YourUserName
spring.datasource.password=YourPassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
spring.sql.init.mode=always
```

Replace `YourUserName` and `YourPassword` with your MySQL database credentials.

1. **Set up the necessary Google API credentials for Google integration:**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project or select an existing project.
    - Enable the necessary APIs for your project (e.g., Google Drive, Gmail, Calendar).
    - In the project dashboard, navigate to the **Credentials** section.
    - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
    - Configure the OAuth consent screen with the required information.
    - Choose the application type as **Web application**.
    - Add the authorized redirect URIs in the **Authorized redirect URIs** section. For example:
        - `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google`
        - `http://localhost:8080/employee/settings/handle-granted-access`
        Replace `localhost:8080` with the base URL of your CRM application.
    - Complete the setup and note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
2. **Modify the Google API scopes for accessing Google services**:
    
    While setting up the Google API credentials, you need to add the required scopes to define the level of access the application has to your Google account. The required scopes depend on the specific features you want to use. Here are the scopes for common Google services:
    
    - Google Drive: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
    - Gmail: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
    - Google Calendar: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
        
        During the setup of your Google credentials, find the section to add the API scopes and include the scopes relevant to the features you intend to use.

        
3. **Configure the redirect URI for the Google authentication flow:**

```
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.redirect-uri={baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}

```

1. Customize the authorization and authentication URLs for the application if needed:

```
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.google.authorization-uri=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.google.token-uri=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token

```

1. Build the application using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install

```

1. Run the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run

```

1. Access the CRM application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
